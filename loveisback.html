  <div class="about-header"> about </div>
  <div class="about-content-1">  Love is Back is an annual zine curated and written by queer-identifying Filipinos living in the Philippines. We started our first issue on June of 2022, in celebration of pride month, and we've wanted to release an issue once every year since then. The zines here are completely free to read online, and the first issue is filled with poetry about love & longing, the questioning & the quotidian, all things queer & all things light. You can download the first issue for free here.
